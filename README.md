#### About ####
** Vortulo ** (translating to "word man" in Esperanto) is a program used to generate context free grammar sentences in Esperanto.
Esperanto was a constructed auxiliary language and as a result has a lot of features which allow for an easy systematic approach to constructing sentences.
However, there exists exceptions which were avoided as best possible, and due to the context free nature, the sentences are far from flawless.
Vortulo was an experiment in the means of viewing a human language in the way we view a coding language in an EMBF structure. 

#### Currently Implemented ####
- Independent clauses
- Dependant clauses, with a subordinating conjunction
- Relative clauses 

** Vortulo ** is currently using the 552 most frequent Esperanto words (as sourced from http://www.esperanto-panorama.net/angla/vortaro.htm) with a few additions of my own.
